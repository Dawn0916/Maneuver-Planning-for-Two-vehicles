Guidance:

----------two_vehicles.m-----------
Run two_vehicles.m to see the results.
Here I set only 5 iterations for visualizing the results quickly.


----------plotV2.m--------------
The trajectories with timing are drawn by plotV2.m, which starts after all 5 iterations finish.
You can take the code plotV2.m as a reference when writing your trajectory code.


--------- nmpc.m---------------
Soving MPC problems.


---------- test.gif -----------
Put test.gif in the same folder with other three m files when running the code, otherwise there will be an Error.
